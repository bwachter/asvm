INSTALL
-------

The current version of asvm relies on libaard. An appropriate
version is included as a git submodule, which you can initialize
by executing the following command within the source directory:

    git submodule update --init

If you already got the initialized submodule, but would like to
jump to a newer release execute the above command without the --init

If you're building from a release tarball a version of libaard is
already included.

Now have a look at config.h. This file includes configurations for
the location of fifos and service directories. Adjust if required.

You can now start the build process by just typing `make'. This will
build both libibaard and the asvm programs. You can influence the
build process by setting some variables:

Q: Set to empty for verbose build
CC: C-compiler, if not cc
CROSS: Prefix for cross toolchain
DIET: diet wrapper

For example, `make Q= CROSS=arm-linux-' will do a verbose build for
Linux/ARM. All variables are passed through to libibaard, of course.

You can install the programs by typing `make install'. You can set a
installation prefix with DESTDIR. Installed programs are:

$(DESTDIR)/usr/sbin/asvm
$(DESTDIR)/usr/bin/svc
$(DESTDIR)/usr/bin/svok -> svc
$(DESTDIR)/usr/bin/svstat -> svc

Links to svok/svstat are provided in case you're using asvm as drop-in
replacement for djbs daemontools.
